# Info

Essential bot for streamer, who play a lot of 150cc Lounge and want to show some stats on stream without switching to Discord. <br/>
Tutorial how to set up your own bot coming soon. <br/>
If you already know how to set it up feel free to deploy it by yourself. (Don't forget to setup the env) <br/>
Main feature is having a database, where you can search via the twitch usernames instead of lounge usernames.

# Disclaimer

This bot was created just for fun so I can play around with node.js a little bit. <br/>
I used to look up the tutorial from @colbyfayock how to code a twitch bot. <br/>
My code won't be the best, but for now it works with almost no flaws.

# Plan for the future

Command to look up players' history name <br/>
Command to show wr time trials (150 and 200cc) <br/>
Overlay for live scores, controlled via the twitch chat
