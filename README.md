# Info

Essential bot for streamer, who plays a lot of 150cc Lounge and want to show some stats on stream without switching to Discord. <br/>
This bot uses tmi.js in order to listen to chat and send messages. <br/>
If you already know how to set it up feel free to deploy it by yourself. (Don't forget to setup the env variables) <br/>
Main feature is having a database, which links a twitch user to a certain lounger player, <br/>
so you can search the lounge data via lounge username and twitch username. <br/>
Use "!help" in your twitch chat to look up how to use the bot. <br/>


# Setup local

I'm too lazy currently lol.

# Disclaimer

This bot was created just for fun so I can play around with node.js a little bit. <br/>
I used to look up the tutorial from @colbyfayock how to code a twitch bot. <br/>
My code won't be the best, but for now it works with almost no flaws. <br/>
Feel free to commit something, if it helps improving my code! <br/>
Since this bot is just a small project of mine and I can't afford paying server costs, <br/>
so only a few Streamer are supported currently.

# Plan for the future

Command to show wr time trials (150 and 200cc), if there is an api for it <br/>
